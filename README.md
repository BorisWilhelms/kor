# Kor

**âš  WARNING: Prototype with unstable API.**  

Kor is a prototype to see if it's easy to introduce a few building blocks to make it faster to extract
structured information with an LLM. 

At the moment, Kor supports one form and does one pass interaction.

## Why the name?

It's fast to type.
